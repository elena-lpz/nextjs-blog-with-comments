# Week 08 Assignment

A blog with comments built using NextJS

# Requirements

This week I achieved all the requirements and some stretch goals

# Design

Wireframes and hifi designs in designs folder

# Reflection

I could not achieve all stretch goals as they seemed to be designed for a different type of blog. Most of them seemed to fit a blog where creating the posts themselves and editing them was the main goal, however in my case the goal was to be able to post comments and edit them. It seemed like inline editing in this case was more fitting and so I did not create a dynamic route to edit the comments.

NextJS was a bit hard to use at times and I feel like I may have made some mistakes when it comes to organizing the files. I found it hard to tell when it was a server or client action only and I think I did not do a good job in that regard.
